## It works

Running your tests with multiple threads does not work. Bugs depend on a specific thread interleaving, which is often impossible to reach by simply rerunning your test multiple times. And data races only occur on specific hardware architectures and JVMs.

Therefore vmlens uses the Java Memory Model to execute all possible thread interleavings and to check for data races in the program flow.

## Even for complicated algorithms 

To test the put method of the class ConcurrentHashMap using two threads takes 353 iterations and less than 3 seconds on my Intel i5 3,40 GHz 4 core CPU.

And by using the @atomic annotation we can build complicated algorithms out of smaller pieces.

## Easy to use

Using vmlens is easy.

Surround your test with a while loop iterating over all thread interleavings using the class AllInterleaving. 

# Example: Read-modify-write race condition

A read-modify-write race happens when reading, modifying, and writing consists, not of one but multiple atomic methods. In the example below get and put are atomic but the complete update method is not. vmlens executes all thread interleavings and reports the interleaving which led to the error. 

```Java
public class TestUpdateWrong {
    public void update(ConcurrentHashMap<Integer, Integer> map) {
        Integer result = map.get(1);
        if (result == null) {
            map.put(1, 1);
        } else {
            map.put(1, result + 1);
        }
    }
    @Test
    public void testUpdate() throws InterruptedException {
        try (AllInterleavings allInterleavings = 
                new AllInterleavings("TestUpdateWrong");) {
            while (allInterleavings.hasNext()) {
                final ConcurrentHashMap<Integer, Integer> map = 
                        new ConcurrentHashMap<Integer, Integer>();
                Thread first = new Thread(() -> {
                    update(map);
                });
                Thread second = new Thread(() -> {
                    update(map);
                });
                first.start();
                second.start();
                first.join();
                second.join();
                assertEquals(2, 
                        map.get(1).intValue());
            }
        }
    }
}
